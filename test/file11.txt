August 5 2010 02:35 AM Mammal-like crocodile fossil found in East Africa scientists report Fossils of an ancient crocodile with mammal-like teeth have been discovered in the Rukwa Rift Basin of Tanzania scientists report in this weeks issue of the journal Nature The unusual creature is changing the picture of animal life at 100 million years ago in what is now sub-Saharan Africa If you only looked at the teeth you wouldnt think this was a crocodile You would wonder what kind of strange mammal or mammal-like reptile it is said study lead author Patrick OConnor associate professor of anatomy in the Ohio University College of Osteopathic Medicine The scientists describe the new species of notosuchian crocodyliform as a small animal its head would fit in the palm of your hand OConnor said that wasnt as heavily armored as other crocodiles except along the tail Other aspects of its anatomy suggest it was a land-dwelling creature that likely feasted on insects and other small animals to survive OConnor and his international research team funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation and the National Geographic Society found a complete specimen of the crocodile in 2008 and now have recovered portions of seven different individuals in southwestern Tanzania The tooth row with molar-like teeth initially puzzled many experts Other ancient and living crocodiles typically boast relatively simple conical teeth that serve to seize and tear prey they swallow flesh in large chunks The molar teeth of the new species named Pakasuchus Paka is the Ki-Swahili name for cat and souchos is Greek for crocodile possessed shearing edges for processing food similar in form to the teeth of some mammalian carnivores Once we were able to get a close look at the teeth we knew we had something new and very exciting OConnor said The research teams discovery that the animals had heavily plated tails but relatively unarmored bodies with gracile limbs suggests that the creatures were quite mobile They probably actively foraged on land unlike water-dwelling crocodiles The new species isnt a close relative of modern crocodilians but is a member of a very successful side branch of the crocodyliform lineage that lived during the Mesozoic Era OConnor said While the specimens of the newly discovered animal and its close relatives are unusual the study suggests that the creatures were abundant during the middle Cretaceous from around 110 million until 80 million years ago The more exploration we do the more we push the boundaries on what we thought we knew about animal life on the planet OConnor noted Based on other fossils discovered as part of the Rukwa Rift Basin Project Pakasuchus lived alongside large plant-eating sauropod and predatory theropod dinosaurs other types of crocodiles turtles and various kinds of fishes We suspect that notosuchians were very successful in the southern hemisphere because they were exploiting a certain ecological niche one in which they were able to successfully compete with other small-bodied terrestrial animals OConnor said This is an environment that was quite different from what we typically think of for crocodiles Little is known about the vegetation during this time period but detailed sedimentological analysis of the Rukwa Rift Basin shows that the landscape was dominated by a large long-lived river system with multiple crisscrossing channels and low-relief vegetated floodplains in between that apparently supported a relatively rich vertebrate fauna said Eric Roberts an assistant professor of geology at James Cook University who collaborated on the research while at Southern Utah University During much of the Cretaceous Period Afro-Arabia India Madagascar Antarctica Australia and South America were joined together as the southern supercontinent Gondwana Relatively few Cretaceous-age mammals have been recovered from this part of the world and most of those discovered dont appear to be related to modern mammals Notosuchian crocodyliforms may have taken up residence in a mammalian niche in Gondwana during the Cretaceous Period One of the reasons were working in different parts of the southern hemisphere including Africa and Antarctica is that not as much exploration has been done in these locales We are still piecing together the puzzle of what animal life was like in these places OConnor said Perhaps we just havent found the mammals yet
