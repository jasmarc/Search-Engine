August 9 2010 05:11 PM Brains wiring: More network than pyramid The brain has been mapped to the smallest fold for at least a century but still no one knows how all the parts talk to each other A study in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences answers that question for a small area of the rat brain and in so doing takes a big step toward revealing the brains wiring The network of brain connections was thought too complex to describe but molecular biology and computing methods have improved to the point that the National Institutes of Health have announced a $30 million plan to map the human connectome The study shows the power of a new method for tracing brain circuits University of Southern California neuroscientists Richard H Thompson and Larry W Swanson used the method to trace circuits running through a hedonic hot spot related to food enjoyment The circuits showed up as patterns of circular loops suggesting that at least in this part of the rat brain the wiring diagram looks like a distributed network Neuroscientists are split between a traditional view that the brain is organized as a hierarchy with most regions feeding into the higher centers of conscious thought and a more recent model of the brain as a flat network similar to the Internet We started in one place and looked at the connections It led into a very complicated series of loops and circuits Its not an organizational chart Theres no top and bottom to it Swanson said The circuit tracing method allows the study of incoming and outgoing signals from any two brain centers It was invented and refined by Thompson over eight years Most other tracing studies at present focus only on one signal in one direction at one location We can look at up to four links in a circuit in the same animal at the same time That was our technical innovation Swanson said The Internet model would explain the brains ability to overcome much local damage Swanson said You can knock out almost any single part of the Internet and the rest of it works Likewise Swanson said There are usually alternate pathways through the nervous system Its very hard to say that any one part is absolutely essential Swanson first argued for the distributed model of the brain in his acclaimed book Brain Architecture: Understanding the Basic Plan Oxford University Press 2003 The PNAS study appears to support his view There is an alternate model Its not proven but lets rethink the traditional way of regarding how the brain works he said The part of the brain you think with the cortex is very important but its certainly not the only part of the nervous system that determines our behavior
