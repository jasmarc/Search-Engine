August 27 2010 3:17 PM PDT Will Facebook face Apple in trying to trademark face When businesses become big some decide to act big too They walk into the legal saloon swagger up to the bar and expect plaudits and favors to come streaming their way Sometimes it is for good reason for they fear that others might trade off the back of their bigness Sometimes though it is just an attempt to live large What then might one think of the news that Facebook is reportedly not merely attempting to trademark the word book but also the word face The trademark application seems to seek a rather broad coverage TechCrunch reports that Aaron Greenspan a classmate of Facebooks Mark Zuckerberg at Harvard and someone who may or may not have been a participant in the companys founding has already laid an objection to the trademark application Greenspan has a company called ThinkComputer and a mobile payment app called FaceCash He has therefore reportedly asked the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for an extension to fully form his discomfort Get outta my face Credit: CC Deney Terrio/Flickr I will admit not to have been entirely au fait with FaceCashs possibilities However who could not have enjoyed some kind of relationship with a thing called FaceTime Apples very nice video chatting telecommunication feature of the iPhone 4 Apple already owns the trademark to FaceTime yet it is very fond of creating subbrands that have a very close verbal identification with each other What if Apple wants to create new versions of FaceTime called say FaceIT through which you could be grilled face-to-face by your most trusted IT professional anywhere in the world Would that be suddenly verboten Yes I know that not everyone wants to talk to an IT professional face-to-face Of course I dont expect such a feature to suddenly appear on iPhone 5 Its just a little too niche But surely the question is whether Facebook can prevent any new product especially one that might already carry some fame with it like FaceTime appearing in the vaguely technologically communicative sphere with the word face at the beginning of its name I have contacted Apple for comment and will update with the companys reply Will there be a face-off Might a lawyer perform a face-plant The possibilities are lets face it fascinating
