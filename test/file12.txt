August 5 2010 02:35 AM Sponge shines light on lifes origin The simple sponge can reveal much about life on Earth Researchers who have sequenced the genome of one Down Under inhabitant are learning just how common those roots are In a paper published online this week in the journal Nature Rice Universitys Nicholas Putnam is among a group of scientists who have established a draft genome sequence for Amphimedon queenslandica a sponge found off the coast of Australia The genome is helping evolutionary biologists connect the dots as they look for DNA sequences shared by metazoans or multicelled animals Sponges are an ancient group with fossils dating back at least 650 million years They are thought to have been the first group of animals to branch from all the others Therefore genes shared by sponges and other animals must have been present in the common ancestor of all metazoans This ancestor would have evolved mechanisms to coordinate cell division growth specialization adhesion and death this suggests that early sponges already had a developmental set of tools similar to those in metazoans today said Putnam an assistant professor of ecology and evolutionary biology Whats exciting is the new things were learning about animal evolution said Putnam who got involved with the project while working at the Department of Energys Joint Genome Institute in 2006 For example sponges have embryos and having the genome helps us look at how they develop and make specific connections to developmental pathways in other animals Its the kind of thing that will lead to a much clearer understanding of what the very first metazoans looked like he said That distant ancestor may well have looked like a sponge For the paper Putnam helped compare Amphimedons draft genome with 13 other complete animal genomes including a selection of invertebrates as well as a choanoflagellate The researchers wrote of a striking conservation of gene structure and genome organization that is common to all We can now say that the large-scale patterns of genome organization weve seen conserved in other animal groups come from the very root of the animal tree Putnam said The challenge ahead is learning what they do The focus of my research is to understand whether patterns that have been around for a billion years have some particular functions or if theyre hanging around because not enough time has gone by to erase them Whats missing is also interesting he said The ancestral patterns of genome organization common to other creatures is absent from certain arthropods invertebrates that include the likes of centipedes and lobsters and nematodes If the missing pattern is neutral youd say that somewhere along the history of those groups the rate of evolutionary change sped up enough to break the connection Putnam said If its functional then somehow those groups overcame whatever constraint is on it in other lineages Also puzzling is that while Amphimedon shares key developmental genes with a diverse set of metazoans its basic structure hasnt changed in 600 million years Given the same roots researchers wonder why it didnt evolve more radically and they are working to identify the differences that gave rise to say nerve cells in other creatures but not sponges Unlocking the basic mechanisms of multicellularity may also help researchers understand what happens when those mechanisms go wrong and lead to cancer and autoimmune disorders
