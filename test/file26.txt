August 28 2010 12:00 PM PDT Woman puts cat in bin Web strikes back As the history of the world over the last year or two has shown it is not easy to work in a bank It places special even unique pressures on individuals so that some make the occasional split second of misjudgment Such a split second occurred for the clearly stressed British bank worker Mary Bale who tried to bring a little levity to her day by putting a cat in a trash bin where it remained unrescued for 15 hours There will be some who will say: Well at least it wasnt a baby Yet the full weight of technological jurisprudence and imprudence has now descended upon Bale It all began last week when the video of a woman putting little Lola the cat into a bin was put on YouTube by her concerned owners They had captured the dreadful moment on their closed-circuit TV security system When it comes to online detection there is an organization that would put the more conventional security services to shame That organization is 4chan It reportedly took 4chans resourceful members a mere few hours to identify Bale Having found her they reportedly began to reveal details of her employment her phone number and that most basic foundation of human existence her Facebook page At first she wondered publicly what all the fuss was about Its just a cat she told a newspaper This was perhaps a slightly injudicious response one that marshaled the energies of the online collective As her infamy spread increasing ingenuity was dedicated to her excoriation A YouTube video embedded below dreamed of a cat putting her in a trash bin It has already enjoyed more than 800000 views at the time of this writing Then one deeply feeling human created Twitter.com/catbinlady It began on Wednesday with this tweet: Just passed a shoe shop Threw one of the sample shoes outside on top of a bus Why do I do these things It then offered observations such as Just kicked the head off next doors gnome For a joke Whos laughing now though Not me Not me Facebook too features expressions of disgust What is remarkable given Facebooks avowed stance against hate speech is that the Mary Bale Hate Group is alive and very much kicking at the time I write this All this Web and flow of invective made Bale go into hiding This had not deterred those who viewed her behavior as ill-befitting the human race The Sun newspaper has created the online game Whack-Cat-Woman This affords you the pleasure of bashing Bales head as it emerges from various green bins strewn about the street In the closed-circuit TV footage Bale was remarkably blase in just grabbing Lola with one hand and disposing of her Unfortunately the Web now has both its hands shaking every last bit of dignity from the so-called Cat Bin Lady And thats not counting the fact that she reportedly may face charges of animal cruelty Perhaps though she will come out and make online videos against animal cruelty The Web might be judge and jury but it also has the power to rehabilitate
