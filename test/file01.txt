July 15 2010 MESSENGER SPACECRAFT REVEALS NEW INFORMATION ABOUT MERCURY WASHINGTON The first spacecraft designed by NASA to orbit Mercury is giving scientists a new perspective on the planets atmosphere and evolution Launched in August 2004 the Mercury Surface Space Environment Geochemistry and Ranging spacecraft known as MESSENGER conducted a third and final flyby of Mercury in September 2009 The probe completed a critical maneuver using the planets gravity to remain on course to enter into orbit around Mercury next year Data from the final flyby has revealed the first observations of ion emissions in Mercurys exosphere or thin atmosphere new information about the planets magnetic substorms and evidence of younger volcanic activity than previously recorded The results are reported in three papers published online in the July 15 edition of Science Express The distribution of individual chemical elements that the spacecraft saw in Mercurys exosphere varied around the planet Detailed altitude profiles of those elements in the exosphere over the north and south poles of the planet were also measured for the first time These profiles showed considerable variability among the sodium calcium and magnesium distributions indicating that several processes are at work and that a given process may affect each element quite differently said Ron Vervack lead author of one of the papers and the spacecrafts participating scientist at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory APL in Laurel Md Emission from ionized calcium in Mercurys exosphere was observed for the first time during the flyby The emission was concentrated over a relatively small portion of the exosphere with most of the emission occurring close to the equatorial plane During its first two flybys of Mercury the spacecraft captured images confirming that the planets early history was marked by pervasive volcanism The spacecrafts third flyby revealed a new chapter in that history within an impact basin 180 miles in diameter that is among the youngest basins yet seen The basin recently named Rachmaninoff has an inner floor filled with smooth plains that differ in color from their surroundings These sparsely cratered plains are younger than the basin they fill and apparently formed from material that once flowed across the surface We interpret these plains to be the youngest volcanic deposits we have yet found on Mercury said Louise Prockter one of the spacecrafts deputy project scientists at APL and lead author of one of the three papers Other observations suggest the planet spanned a much greater duration volcanism than previously thought perhaps extending well into the second half of solar system history For the first time the spacecraft revealed substorm-like build-up or loading of magnetic energy in Mercurys magnetic tail The increases in energy measured in Mercurys magnetic tail were very large They occurred quickly lasting only two to three minutes from beginning to end These increases in tail magnetic energy at Mercury are about 10 times greater than at Earth and the substorm-like events run their course about 50 times more rapidly Magnetic substorms are space-weather disturbances that occur intermittently on Earth usually several times per day and last from one to three hours Earth substorms are accompanied by a range of phenomena such as the majestic auroral displays seen in the Arctic and Antarctic skies Substorms also are associated with hazardous energetic particle events that can wreak havoc with communications and Earth-observing satellites The extreme tail loading and unloading observed at Mercury implies that the relative intensity of substorms must be much larger than at Earth said James A Slavin a space physicist at NASAs Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt Md and a member of the spacecrafts science team and lead author of another paper The new measurements give fresh insight on the time duration of Mercurys substorms Scientists await more extensive measurements when the spacecraft is in orbit Every time weve encountered Mercury weve discovered new phenomena said Sean Solomon the missions principal investigator at the Carnegie Institution of Washington Were learning that Mercury is an extremely dynamic planet and it has been so throughout its history After MESSENGER has been safely inserted into orbit around Mercury next March well be in for a terrific show In addition to flying by Mercury the spacecraft flew past Earth in August 2005 and Venus in October 2006 and June 2007 Approximately 98 percent of Mercurys surface has been imaged by NASA spacecraft After this spacecraft goes into orbit around Mercury for a yearlong study of the planet it will observe the polar regions which are the only unobserved areas of the planet The spacecraft was designed and built by APL The mission is managed and operated by APL for NASAs Science Mission Directorate in Washington
