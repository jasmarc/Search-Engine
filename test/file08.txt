Aug 26 2010 NASAS KEPLER MISSION DISCOVERS TWO PLANETS TRANSITING SAME STAR WASHINGTON NASAs Kepler spacecraft has discovered the first confirmed planetary system with more than one planet crossing in front of or transiting the same star The transit signatures of two distinct planets were seen in the data for the sun-like star designated Kepler-9 The planets were named Kepler-9b and 9c The discovery incorporates seven months of observations of more than 156000 stars as part of an ongoing search for Earth-sized planets outside our solar system The findings will be published in Thursdays issue of the journal Science Keplers ultra-precise camera measures tiny decreases in the stars brightness that occur when a planet transits them The size of the planet can be derived from these temporary dips The distance of the planet from the star can be calculated by measuring the time between successive dips as the planet orbits the star Small variations in the regularity of these dips can be used to determine the masses of planets and detect other non-transiting planets in the system In June mission scientists submitted findings for peer review that identified more than 700 planet candidates in the first 43 days of Kepler data The data included five additional candidate systems that appear to exhibit more than one transiting planet The Kepler team recently identified a sixth target exhibiting multiple transits and accumulated enough follow-up data to confirm this multi-planet system Keplers high quality data and round-the-clock coverage of transiting objects enable a whole host of unique measurements to be made of the parent stars and their planetary systems said Doug Hudgins the Kepler program scientist at NASA Headquarters in Washington Scientists refined the estimates of the masses of the planets using observations from the W.M Keck Observatory in Hawaii The observations show Kepler-9b is the larger of the two planets and both have masses similar to but less than Saturn Kepler-9b lies closest to the star with an orbit of about 19 days while Kepler-9c has an orbit of about 38 days By observing several transits by each planet over the seven months of data the time between successive transits could be analyzed This discovery is the first clear detection of significant changes in the intervals from one planetary transit to the next what we call transit timing variations said Matthew Holman a Kepler mission scientist from the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge Mass This is evidence of the gravitational interaction between the two planets as seen by the Kepler spacecraft In addition to the two confirmed giant planets Kepler scientists also have identified what appears to be a third much smaller transit signature in the observations of Kepler-9 That signature is consistent with the transits of a super-Earth-sized planet about 1.5 times the radius of Earth in a scorching near-sun 1.6 day-orbit Additional observations are required to determine whether this signal is indeed a planet or an astronomical phenomenon that mimics the appearance of a transit NASAs Ames Research Center in Moffett Field Calif manages Keplers ground system development mission operations and science data analysis NASAs Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena Calif managed Kepler mission development Ball Aerospace and Technologies Corp in Boulder Colo developed the Kepler flight system and supports mission operations with the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics at the University of Colorado in Boulder The Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore archives hosts and distributes the Kepler science data
