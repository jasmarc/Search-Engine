Aug 02 2010 NASA AND ESAS FIRST JOINT MISSION TO MARS SELECTS INSTRUMENTS WASHINGTON NASA and the European Space Agency ESA have embarked on a joint program to explore Mars in the coming decades and selected the five science instruments for the first mission The ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter scheduled to launch in 2016 is the first of a series of planned joint robotic missions to the Red Planet It will study the chemical makeup of the Martian atmosphere with a 1000-fold increase in sensitivity over previous Mars orbiters The mission will focus on trace gases including methane which could be potentially geochemical or biological in origin and be indicators for the existence of life on Mars The mission also will serve as an additional communications relay for Mars surface missions beginning in 2018 Independently NASA and ESA have made amazing discoveries up to this point said Ed Weiler associate administrator of NASAs Science Mission Directorate in Washington Working together well reduce duplication of effort expand our capabilities and see results neither ever could have achieved alone NASA and ESA invited scientists worldwide to propose the spacecrafts instruments The five selected were from 19 proposals submitted in April Both agencies evaluated the submissions and chose those with the best science value and lowest risk The selection of the instruments begins the first phase of the new NASA-ESA alliance for future ventures to Mars The instruments and the principal investigators are: Mars Atmosphere Trace Molecule Occultation Spectrometer A spectrometer designed to detect very low concentrations of the molecular components of the Martian atmosphere: Paul Wennberg California Institute of Technology Pasadena Calif High Resolution Solar Occultation and Nadir Spectrometer A spectrometer designed to detect traces of the components of the Martian atmosphere and to map where they are on the surface: Ann C Vandaele Belgian Institute for Space Aeronomy Brussels Belgium ExoMars Climate Sounder An infrared radiometer that provides daily global data on dust water vapor and other materials to provide the context for data analysis from the spectrometers: John Schofield NASAs Jet Propulsion Laboratory JPL Pasadena Calif High Resolution Stereo Color Imager A camera that provides four-color stereo imaging at a resolution of two million pixels over an 8.5 km swath: Alfred McEwen University of Arizona Mars Atmospheric Global Imaging Experiment A wide-angle multi-spectral camera to provide global images of Mars in support of the other instruments: Bruce Cantor Malin Space Science Systems San Diego Calif The science teams on all the instruments have broad international participation from Europe and the United States with important hardware contributions from Canada and Switzerland To fully explore Mars we want to marshal all the talents we can on Earth said David Southwood ESA director for Science and Robotic Exploration Now NASA and ESA are combining forces for the joint ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter mission Mapping methane allows us to investigate further that most important of questions: Is Mars a living planet and if not can or will it become so in the future NASA and ESA share a common interest in conducting robotic missions to the Red Planet for scientific purposes and to prepare for possible human visits After a series of extensive discussions the science heads of both agencies agreed on a plan of cooperation during a June 2009 meeting in Plymouth England later confirmed by ESA Director General Jean-Jacques Dordain and NASA Administrator Charles Bolden in a statement of intent that was signed in November The plan consists of two Mars cooperative missions in 2016 and 2018 and a later joint sample return mission The 2016 mission features the European-built ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter a European-built small lander demonstrator a primarily-U.S. international science payload and NASA-provided launch vehicle and communications components ESA member states will provide additional instrument support The 2018 mission consists of a European rover with a drilling capability a NASA rover capable of caching selected samples for potential future return to Earth a NASA landing system and a NASA launch vehicle These activities are designed to serve as the foundation of a cooperative program to increase science returns and move the agencies toward a joint Mars sample return mission in the 2020s NASAs Mars Exploration Program seeks to characterize and understand Mars as a dynamic system including its present and past environment climate cycles geology and potential for life JPL manages the program and development of the NASA-supplied instruments for the 2016 orbiter for NASAs Science Mission Directorate in Washington
