September 2 2010 11:12 AM PDT The mystery of the disappearing Facebook-Ping integration After Apple introduced its social music discovery service Ping on Wednesday some people reported they were able to use Facebook Connect to find people to follow But a day later that feature doesnt appear to be supported by Facebook And a lot of people are wondering why Last night before going to sleep I downloaded iTunes 10 and set up my Ping account more on that later As part of the setup I signed up with Facebook Connect so I could find my social graph ready to recommend songs Om Malik founder of GigaOm wrote Thursday I woke up this morning and expected to see Ping activity in my Facebook account and well lets just say nothing is going on According to Malik Ping is not communicating with Facebook and vice versa So what happened It was there Wednesday and even made a cameo at Apples presentation according to screenshots captured from the live stream One slide clearly says find friends via Facebook or e-mail Once you sign up for Ping you get a welcome e-mail from Apple the text of which refers to finding friends through Facebook see below Yet people who logged in to the service Thursday only have the option to find new friends via e-mail The confusion seems to stem from some disagreement between Facebook and Apple The reason as articulated by Apple CEO Steve Jobs in an interview with AllThingsD on Wednesday: Facebook wanted onerous terms that we could not agree to Its not clear what those terms were as he did not elaborate Facebook didnt offer any hints either When asked about Jobs comments the company issued this statement: Facebook believes in connecting people with their interests and weve partnered with innovative developers around the world who share this vision Facebook and Apple have cooperated successfully in the past to offer people great social experiences and look forward to doing so in the future That leaves the door open for possible Facebook-Ping integration at a future date But for now Ping and Facebook are still on unfriendly terms Update 3:05 p.m PDT: The word is that Facebook may have pulled the plug on the Ping integration at the last minute AllThingsD hears from unnamed sources that Facebook blocked Apples use of the Facebook API within Ping since it violated its terms of service As a result Apple reportedly then killed the advertised find-Ping-friends-via-Facebook feature Facebooks API is generally open for anyone to use but there are a few rules The companys developer agreement states that if an application exceeds more than 100 million API calls per day please contact us as you may be subject to additional terms Apple says there are 160 million iTunes customers and therefore potential users of Ping It seems those additional terms whatever they were are the onerous ones Jobs referred to Update 4:55 p.m PDT: A Facebook spokeswoman wouldnt confirm whether the company had disallowed Apples use of the Facebook API but did say this: Were working with Apple to resolve this issue Weve worked together successfully in the past and we look forward to doing so in the future
